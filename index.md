         <h2>About this project</h2>
         <p>The Education Data Explorer is the online download tool of the Education Data Portal. This initiative of the Urban Institute’s <a href="https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/center-education-data-and-policy">Center on Education Data and Policy</a> draws on data from most major national data sources on schools, districts, and colleges, harmonizing variables and documentation to make it easier to look at trends and combine data. We hope this site will empower researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to generate rigorous, accurate, and actionable insights to improve student outcomes. To stay up-to-date on the latest developments, <a href="https://www.tfaforms.com/4644066?tfa_1927=EDD">sign up for our newsletter</a>.</p>
